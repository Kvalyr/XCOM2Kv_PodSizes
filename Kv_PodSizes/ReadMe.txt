Configurable Pod Sizes by Kvalyr

Requires XCOM2 Community Highlander: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1134256495
If you experience crashes, double-check that the Community Highlander is installed.
This might be compatible with the LW2 Highlander but I have only tested with the community highlander.


This mod applies its affects AFTER .ini files have been loaded. It should not have ini conflicts with mods that add or remove Encounters/Pods.
That means that this mod IS compatible with other mods that adjust pod sizes, such as "[WOTC] Larger Enemy Pods" by Charmed:

Adjust values in XComKv_PodSizes.ini to your preference. This mod won't have any perceptible effect on your game unless you change some of its default values.
Comments in the file explain the purpose of each setting.

Planned Features:
* Adjust pod sizes by their EncounterID
* Add/Remove ForceSpawnTemplateNames to Pods by EncounterID
