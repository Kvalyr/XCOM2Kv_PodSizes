Configurable Pod Sizes by Kvalyr

=== Requirements ===
* Requires WOTC.
* Requires XCOM2 Community Highlander: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1134256495
* MCM Strongly Recommended: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667104300

If you experience crashes, double-check that the Community Highlander is installed. This mod absolutely will not work without it.

=== Compatibility ===
* Does NOT require a new game. Removing this mod should also restore Pod sizes to their defaults in an ongoing game.

* This mod applies its affects AFTER .ini files have been loaded. It should not have ini conflicts with mods that add or remove Encounters/Pods.

  * That means that this mod IS compatible with other mods that adjust pod sizes, such as "[WOTC] Larger Enemy Pods" by Charmed: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1125516692 

=== How to use ===
* Adjust values using the Mod Configuration Menu (link above). 

* This mod won't have any perceptible effect on your game unless you change some of its default values.

* IMPORTANT: Quit to desktop and launch the game again after changing settings. (A future version will eliminate this)

* If not using the MCM: Just use the MCM. 
If you really insist: Adjust values in XComKv_PodSizes_Settings.ini (NOT _Defaults.ini) to your preference. 

* IMPORTANT, Repeated: Quit to desktop and launch the game again after changing settings or they won't have any effect. (A future version will eliminate this)

=== Known Issues: ===
* PodSizeMappings in this mod's .ini currently have no effect. Feature will be restored later.

* Game must be restarted for changes to settings to have any effect.

=== Planned Features: ===
* Adjust pod sizes by their EncounterID

* Add/Remove ForceSpawnTemplateNames to Pods by EncounterID

* Filter by individual unit types in settings. (E.g.; "Don't adjust Chryssalid pods", etc.)
